1. Based on Page Object Model, create automated test for the scenario: Using Google Translate application (https://translate.google.com/)

▪ select source language from the drop-down menu on the left

▪ select translation language from the drop-down menu on the right

▪ enter the initial text in the input field on the left

▪ make sure that the actual translation result in the right field is correct

Source, Translation languages, initial text and expected result should be taken from a separate  data file (.json, .yaml, or .xlsx), for example (but not necessarily the exact word!):

▪ source language: German

▪ translation language: Spanish

▪ initial text: "Demokratien"

▪ expected result: "Democracias"

2. Add scenario: click swap languages button and verify the result.

3. Add scenario: clear the input field, click "select input tool" button, select "screen keyboard" and  enter "Hi!"
